About
-----

This repo contains my personal dotfiles, which I use on unix and unix-like
systems of varying flavors. They are published here because occasionally
I want to share some or all of them, or use them as an example, and this
is an easy way to do so. Feel free to use anything you find here.

The most important configs relate to Bash and Vim.

Bash-related files
------------------

* bash_profile
* bashrc
* bash/*
* inputrc (readline)

Vim-related files
-----------------

* vimrc
* gvimrc
* vim/*

Installation
------------

Use 'rake install' to install symlinks into $HOME.
