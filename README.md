About
-----

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which I use on unix systems of
varying flavors. They are published here because I occasionally want to share
them or use them as examples, and this is an easy way to do so. Feel free to
use anything you find here.

Installation
------------

Use 'rake install' to install symlinks into $HOME, if you really want them
all there. Rake will ask you about each file, so it shouldn't overwrite
anything you already have in place.

Compatibility
-------------

I am a bash user; much of the shell environment may well work in other advanced
Bourne derivatives such as zsh, but some of it will break.

I regularly use this setup with Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and FreeBSD.
