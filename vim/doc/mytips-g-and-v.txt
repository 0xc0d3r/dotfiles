|:g| globally applies the subsequent command to all lines matching a regex.

|:v| is the same as :v but operates on the conVerse, lines that do not match
the regex.

Address prefixing:

:.,+21g/foo/d       delete any lines matching /foo/ from current + 21 lines

:.,$v/bar/d         delete any lines from here to EOF not matching /bar/

Can mix this with |:s| and/or |:%| do to stuff like this:

:%g/foo/s/bar/zzz/g

For every line containing 'foo', substitute all 'bar' with 'zzz'.
